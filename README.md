## Direction-Control-of-DC-Motor

During my tenure in the **Team Karting Manipal Taskphase**, I was assigned the task of designing an **H-Bridge circuit** to control the direction of a **DC motor** under the following conditions:

- ðŸ”¹ **Forward Direction:** Operates for **2 seconds**  
- ðŸ”¹ **Reverse Direction:** Operates for **3 seconds**  
- ðŸ”¹ **Stop:** Remains idle for **5 seconds**  
- ðŸ”¹ The sequence repeats in a **cyclic fashion**
